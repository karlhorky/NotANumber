> One thing I don't like about this is how much text there is _before_ the list of sub pages. At the same time, I want to make sure this intro is here because I want to add context to the whole series. Is it ok to put this much text?

When I wrote the [debugger post](../debugger), I had a vague idea of how [Babel]() works - it takes your code, turns it into an AST, passes the AST through a series of plugins, and turns the modified AST back into code. This was enough for me to utilize most of the power of Babel, using it to power the interactive widgets on this blog. But I was nonetheless left with a pretty big knowledge gap - how does Babel turn the sequence of characters that is your source code and turn it into the all powerful AST?

A few weekends ago I set out to overcome this knowledge gap by trying to rewrite the entire Babel compiler from scratch. I had one goal: to convert the following code snippet:

```js
function hello(message) {
  console.log(message)
}
```

To the following code:

```js
function print(message) {
  console.log(message)
}
```

Without using any `str.replace()` or regex tricks.

In the first part of this series, we'll go over everything that I did to accomplish that goal:

<Figure>
  <PageList />
</Figure>

Once we've achieved this goal, we'll extend our compiler to work better with the JavaScript language as a whole and make it more "production-ready":
