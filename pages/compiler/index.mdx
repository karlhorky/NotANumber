_"How does Babel work?"_ is a question that I never really knew the answer to. When I wrote the [debugger post](../debugger), I had a vague idea of what syntax trees were and how to use them, but I never took the time to sit down and go over _how_ these syntax trees were actually made.

A few weekends ago I set out to figure this out by trying to rewrite the entire Babel compiler from scratch. I had one goal: to create a compiler that can turn this:

```js
function hello(message) {
  console.log(message)
}
```

Into this:

```js
function print(message) {
  console.log(message)
}
```

In this series, we'll cover _everything_ that I learned in the process.
