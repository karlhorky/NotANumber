to make the boilerplate component mobile responsive, i need to change it so that only x number of characters are visible at any given time.

- so instead of moving the cursor, we move the letters to match the cursor

it would be neat to be able to trim the debugger statements out of the code
- i'm not really sure if they only add confusion or not
